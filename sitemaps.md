# Sitemaps

- Provide additional info on the content, further helping crawlers to understand the website.
- On large websites, with 500+ pages, it's a good idea to have one, since it's hard to ensure every page links another internal page.
- On newer websites it's also good, as it's very unlikely that the website will be endorsed by other sites.
- There are tools to create a sitemap, and Google provides documentation on the process.
