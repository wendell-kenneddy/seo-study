# Core Web Vitals

Basically ways to measure a website performance, accessibility and SEO.

- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): time to load the greatest chunk of content on the page.
- FID (First Input Delay): time to being able to interact with the page.
- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): does the page keeps changing even after the first loading?

In short, those metrics should not be greater than a small amount of time, otherwise the page will feel unresponsive.
